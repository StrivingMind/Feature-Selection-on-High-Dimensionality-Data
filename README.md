# Feature Selection on High Dimensionality Data
Feature Selection in High-Dimensional Spaces for Drug Discovery

Overview
This project explores and compares various feature selection techniques in high-dimensional datasets for drug detection, focusing on dimensionality reduction methods such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA), and Independent Component Analysis (ICA).

Package Requirements
The following Python libraries are required to run this code. It is recommended to use the specified versions to ensure compatibility:

pandas==1.3.0
numpy==1.21.0
scikit-learn==0.24.2
seaborn==0.11.1
matplotlib==3.4.2
scipy==1.7.0


Run Instructions
Follow these instructions to set up the environment and execute the code.


Step 1: 
Open the .ipynb file in Google collab or in your preferable IDE.

Step 2: Accessing the File
Upload the dataset (DrugDiscovery.csv) available on CHEMBL website or download from "https://drive.google.com/file/d/1g9gKJaG16AVPsQ8efJO2hG8uMtOBSFPu/view?usp=share_link" to your Google Drive.

Step 3: Load Dataset
Specify the path to your dataset file. If the path differs, replace "/content/drive/MyDrive/DrugDiscovery.csv" with the actual path.

Step 4:
Run the cells sequentially to preprocess the data, apply dimensionality reduction techniques, and generate visualizations.
